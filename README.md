# Workman-KDE
Grey and black KDE Plasma theme made to cut down on distractions and look good at the same time.
I use these themes daily when I am working on stuff and usually about all the time because not only do they help me concentrate they also are very neat and clean themes.There is 4 color schemes so that you can have different shades of darkness.
